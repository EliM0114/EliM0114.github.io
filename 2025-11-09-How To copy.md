# Churches and Subway*

No, not the restaurants...

These two modalities are staples for a thriving community. Churches bring community and outreach while subways are a necessary mode of transport. These might be the only two spots in a city where the rich mingle with the poor. The doctor with the unemployed. The elderly and new borns. 

Churches and subways are the melting pots within your community. No other spot has what these locations do. 

TBD.
