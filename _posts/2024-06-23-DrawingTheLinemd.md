## Where do you draw the line?

Dave Scott, six time Hawaii Ironman champion. This marks him as one of the best athletes ever. Accomplishing this takes discipline, a lot of it.

Scott is well known after the fact for one strange "performance enhancer". He would rinse his cottage cheese so he would not consume any extra fat.

As an endurance runner myself, I know that the big struggle is getting *enough* calories. Training for an Ironman is no different. Consuming some calories is almost always better than eating nothing. Eating enough clean calories is best, but it is extremly hard to consumer the necessary amount of only healthy calories. 

Even from my eyes, Scott washing his cottage cheese seems absurd. No way that actually makes a difference. It really isn't about the cottage cheese though. It is his unwavering commitment to find any edge over his opponents.

Everyone has to draw the line of what they are willing to do to get more performance. Dave Scott virtually had no line. He dedicated his whole life to become champion. His extreme lifestyle paid off.

Most of us are unable to have this much dedication to one craft. We have school, work, family, and other distractions that prevent us for this dedication. As a result, we unintentionally draw an imaginary line of what we are willing to do to become the best. 

I know I am not washing my cottage cheese. I do not have that discipline, and the mental weight of adhering to that outweighs the benefits in my eyes. Am I willing to get the necessary sleep each night? Train as I am supposed to? These seem like the bare minimum to me. Going furhter, am I willing to cross train and lift the necessary amount of time? Do all necessary injury prevention and recovery so I can train at this level? Count my calories to make sure I eat enough? This is where the line starts for me. I would say I do most of this most of the time. I lack discipline to be 100% consistent at these things. 

If my line is further, closer to Dave Scott's, these actions become second nature. 

As a message to myself

Do the big things right, be the best at the little things, and extend the line as far I can. 

Here is a quote: “Everyone would like to be the best, but most lack the discipline to figure out with egoless clarity what they can be the best at and the will to do whatever it takes to turn that potential into reality.”

There is no doubt that Dave Scott faced ridicule for his strange actions. He did nothing wrong except being the best. It doesn't matter what others think. Turn your potential into reality.
