# **Eli's 14 Rules of Travel*

Be Prepared

Fanny pack...yes please

Noise cancellation is key

Do not take the last flight of the day or else you might get stuck

Manners go a long way

Cash = King

Pack less than you think you need

No need to rush

Gate agent's can help immensely 

Asking locals what their favorite thing do is a great way to have some fun

Do what you want to do

Don't look back

Ride the high before the crash

Wear a suit
