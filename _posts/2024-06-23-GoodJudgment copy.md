## Good Judgment

Writing this quick to hold my future self accountable

Over the next 2 months, I will be competing in the UBS Asset Managment Challenge through the Good Judgment Project

GJopen is something I have wanted to do for a while. I just needed a reason. I will update this thread with my progress of my Brier Score throughout the challenge. 

June 30: Testing the waters with some questions ending soon. I want to see first hand and get a feel for the Brier Score calculations before I make any in the UBS challenge. A bad first forecast in the challenge could be detrimental.
I would imagine the system accounts for this, but in the Superforcasting book, Tetlock mentions how if a group all says something has a 75% chance of happening, it is realistically higher chance than that. Each perosn has derived that 75% chance from a variety of sources and thus crowd forcast has a 'diversified' prediction. 
As I get nearer to end date, maybe playing the system and being more aggressive than the crowd is a good idea. This will not work if the crowd is an 'efficient' market and it is already adjusted in. Also, looking at the reasoning behind some of the forcasts makes it seem that not everyone has done extensive research. It might just be more beneficial to do the predicitions on my own and not 'play the game'. 
Keeping up with 20 questions over the next 45 days will take a lot of time. It might be worth considering only focusing on a chunk of those questions to lower my RBS and defaulting to the crowd forcast to reach the minimum.

Update: The wisdom of the crowd is not a great strategy. I over estimated the ability of the crowd. Many of the predictions are outdated or flawed in their initial prediction. 

Many of my forecasts are coming towards the end of the challenge. This could be hard to overcome because length of forecast is accounted in the relative brier score.

As of now, I think only 25 people will hit the threshold of 20 questions. Probably only a small amount are actually competing for the challenge. I like my odds at the moment.
