## **Prologue**

In this post, I will be going through my week long travel vacation through central Europe. This took place after my summer abroad stint in Rome in the summer of 2023. In total I spent 8 days visiting Vienna, Prague, and Berlin. This is a place for me to recount my trip from my perspective today. 

## **Vienna**
To get to Vienna from Rome, it is a 12-hour train ride. My travel companion, Jackson, and I elected to take a sleeper train to maximize the daytime we had in Vienna. 

From Rome, we had about an hour's layover in Bologna to catch the long train. During this short break, I helped a confused woman buy a ticket. The station was surprisingly busy at 11:30 p.m. As our departure time was nearing, we could not find the train marked "Wien". It was not there! After asking around, we eventually determined that the train listed under a closer destination with half the train continuing to Vienna. We were only about 50% sure this was correct. There was an American family in the same boat being confused with German infrastructure. 

Our sleeper cart consisted of six firm beds, three stacked on each side. Two were occupied by a German couple with the top bunk occupied by Jackson and I. It was a bumpy ride, so I popped some melatonin hoping to sleep throughout the night. It was a better night of sleep than I expected given my sleeping arrangments. I slept fully clothed, with shoes on, and with no pillow or blanket. Our cabin awoke to an extremely nice and bald Wiener who was to take our breakfast order. I chose to have the complimentary coffee and a bread roll with jam. This meal was surprisingly appetizing. Twelve short hours later, we arrived in Wien.

### Day 1 
<sup>June 23, 2023<sup>

It is at this point in writing that I have to consult pictures to keep the timeline straight. After checking into our hostel, we spent the day walking around and deciding what our plan of action should be. We got a student discount into the House of Music museum. It was an interactive experience that gave me flashbacks to elementary school fieldtrips. I can only imagine this is Vienna's equivilent of Kansas City's science city. 

The game plan for night one was to go see a rendition of Vilvaldi's Four Seasons inside Karlskirche (listed as one of Vienna's [most beautiful churches](https://travelnotesandbeyond.com/churches-in-vienna/)). After, we would head east onto an island in the river to experience [Donauinselfest Festival](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donauinselfest#:~:text=The%20Donauinselfest%20(German%20for%20%22Danube,million%20visitors%20over%203%20days!)) ,which is the biggest open air festival in the world.

The Four Season's concert was beautiful, especially given the setting. My mind was a little pre occupied hoping I would be able to catch Bonnie Tyler's Total Eclipse of the Heart (I didn't). At nightfall, we were on our way to the Danube River in which we could not figure out how to use public transport to get onto the island. We could see the shining lights from the multiple stages and decided to walk across a huge pedestrian bridge to get on the island. This dropped us off right next to the main stage where we could hear them rocking. This act was not something I ever expected to hear. The best way to describe The BossHoss is a country, German-Mexican, rock fusion band. Maybe not sounding the best on stage, but the crowd (me included) were definitely into their performance. The peak of the show had to have been when they played the familiar Jolene in their German accent. 

Back at the hostel, we socialized a little bit with some of the residents. A Canadian master's student releasing some stress froma big speech she was about to give in Berlin and what she claimed she was not ready for, a French student named Leslie who had the strongest accent I have ever heard and figuring out her name was as far as I got, and a Spanish student all getting their travels in. 

I tuned in early for bed in our room of 6 people.
