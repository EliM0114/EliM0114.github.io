### Evolution of a Person

Very few things in life scare me. Finding joy in the toils we are suffering is not hard for me to do when the end is in sight. I always seem to find the end. That is, only when the end is clear and visible. Back some time ago, I heard a fact that scared me. It kept me up at night and dominated my actions. Most people do not change after around the age of 30. You listen to the same music, same friends, hobbies, lifestyle and personality. Coming out of high school, a time with an extraordinary amount of change, being stagnant scared me. 

As I have experienced a little bit more, maybe you do not want to change. Oddly, stagnation could be satisyfing if a person is completely content with their life. What if your current self is the best self you will ever be? Then being stagnant is acceptable. To ride your best throughout the rest of your life is something I would take in an instant. 

My current self is a product of every single past experience I have had. Whether conscience change or not, I am a product of my past. This raises some problems. It means we can unconscientiously change everyday. Without proper self reflection on a consistent basis, our current life experiences are compoundly affecting who we fundamentaly are. One day, do we wake up to be someone who is unrecognizable? Similiar to the Ship of Theseus, a small part of us can change every single day. If that is true, are we the same person we were yesterday, a year ago, a decade ago? I have the same flesh and can be traced and accounted for from my birth to me sitting here writing this. Has my personality and life experiences changed me into someone I am not? The discrepencies between actions and thoughts about who I am seem to answer this question. 

I have thought I had a set boundaries of how I interact with the world, but this previous set boundary has seemed to move, expand, or change in some form to a position it was not at previously. 

Change is okay, but our values should not. Set values about who you want to be in the future, and be unapologetic for sticking to your own truths. Do not drink the kool-aid of the world to abandon these values. It might taste good now, but will give you cavaties.
We will discover more about ourselves and have to append these values. In the moment, if you know who you are and stick to it, I don't think you can complain.
