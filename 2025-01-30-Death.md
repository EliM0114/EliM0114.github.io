# Death*

I cannot help to think that being sad in death is inherently selfish. That is not to say our sadness should be taken in vain. The reasons we are sad are selfish. I am sad that all the memories we had together are just that, memories. Perhaps I am sad I did not cherish the moments we had together more, or made an effort to create more. These reasons are sad for my own reasons, not for her. Ultimately, I believe this stems from our human desire to be loved. Grandparents, parents, friends and others who have unrequited for us, we often take for granted. Deep down, we do not want to be alone. Her death, is one less person who has that love for us. 
Death does not sever the love we had for each other. 
I am forever greatful that I had the opportunity to experience her love and share the Earth with her. Most importantly, I am proud to call her my Grandma. For all of us,
without her we would not be where we are. I will continute to live like she is still through me because she is still alive in all of us.
