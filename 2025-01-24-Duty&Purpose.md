# Duty & Purpose*
The purpose of this is to find contentment in your heart to drive performance.
The end goal to drive performance
1. Your belief about who you are and what's possible for you
2. Your ability to focus and be fully engaged in the moment--heart, mind and body
3. Your freedom to play like a kid, curiously exploring possibilities, excited for challenges that may arise

Purpose:
Why do you go to school? Why do you run? Why do you wake up to go run in the cold at 6a.m.? Surface level answers would be to get a degree and a mixture of enjoyment in running and because coach said so. 
Going deeper, what drove your life to this moment? Is it your purpose to receive an education? Do you do this to run a 1 second PR? I mean, at the end of the day it is just running. 

How do we deal with our cicrumstances and the cards we are dealt? The most extraordinary people view their circumstances similiarly. 

Creating fulfillment in our heart starts from identifying where our truth is for our life. 
We are a sum of our past. We view the world from that lens. Our imagination, and our dreams, are forever invading our memories, and since we are all apt to believe in the reality of our fantasies, we end up transofrming our lies into truths. Of course, fantasy and reality are equally personal, and equally felt, so this confusion is a matter of only relative importance. 


What were we born for? What is our duty? We all wear different hats. Athlete, scholar, friend, fishing club vice president. Our actions should be driven with the sole focus on fulfilling our duties. Oftentimes, it is easy to be too focused on short term wins, temporary happiness, surface level achievments. We need to focus on the journey. Do not focus on low hanging fruit on a single bush when an orchard awaits.

Heart first, performance next
